UCSD Scientific Python User Group
==========

###Mission

The Scientific Python User Group was created to foster an informal environment for students to learn
more about the constantly expanding scientific Python ecosystem. We plan to have monthly meeting
structured with two students giving short presentations on how they use open-source Python
resources to support their research. We have established three major goals: 
 * To further develop awareness and knowledge of the growing pool of resources within the Python ecosystem and how
they can be used within diverse areas of academic research.  
 * To expose students to good software
practices and highlight the technical underpinnings that are crucial to good research but often get
skipped over in traditional research presentations.  
 * To encourage use and contribution to open-
source scientific software.
